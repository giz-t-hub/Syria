### National Vision, Strategy, Masterplan <a name="national-vision-strategy-masterplan"></a> 

Transport:
- The proposed national transport action plan for Syria supports the transport section of the 11th Five-Year Plan by addressing funding sources and allocation. It evaluates traditional public sector funding, explores additional revenue from a fuel surcharge, and proposes a method to prioritize investment projects. The plan aims to ensure financial sustainability while achieving transport sector objectives. https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/968951468117285197/pdf/687460ESW0P11100Draft0April07002011.pdf

General:
- The Strategic Plan 2030 for Syria is a 10-year roadmap for post-war sustainable growth, focusing on economic, social, and environmental development. It prioritizes political reform, infrastructure modernization, economic diversification, and social inclusion.  
Implementation follows four phases: relief, recovery, reconstruction, and sustainability. Key goals include food security, water conservation, energy security, job creation, and technological advancement. The plan also addresses refugee return, social protection, and environmental sustainability, aiming to build a resilient and self-sufficient economy by 2030.

### Climate and energy policies <a name="climate-energy-policies"></a> 

Mitigation:
- The 11th Five-Year Plan 2011-2015 includes several sectoral targets related to climate change, notably aimed at providing a sustainable transport matrix in Syria, enhanced renewable energy production, and the sustainable development of rural areas (drafted but not officially adopted).
- Syria's First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 2018 https://climate-laws.org/documents/syrian-arab-republic-first-ndc_c98b?id=syrian-arab-republic-first-ndc_e25e
- The First National Communication (NC1) of the Syrian Arab Republic is a report submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It outlines Syriaâ€™s efforts to address climate change, including greenhouse gas inventories, mitigation and adaptation measures, vulnerabilities to climate change, and policy recommendations. The document provides insights into Syriaâ€™s environmental challenges, energy consumption patterns, and potential strategies for integrating sustainability and climate resilience into national development plans. https://climate-laws.org/documents/syrian-arab-republic-national-communication-nc-nc-1_b27c?l=syria&id=syrian-arab-republic-national-communication-nc-nc-1_ff4f
    
Adaptation

Energy policy:
- The Syrian Master Plan for Renewable Energy 2010 (no link publicly available) aimed to develop a strategic framework for integrating renewable energy sources into the country's energy mix. It was designed to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, enhance energy security, and promote sustainability. The plan focused on expanding solar, wind, and biomass energy while improving energy efficiency across sectors. Implemented by Syriaâ€™s National Energy Research Center in collaboration with GIZ, it outlined key targets, policy recommendations, and investment priorities. The plan was later updated into the Master Plan for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energies to align with evolving energy needs and international best practices.

### Studies and research papers <a name="studies-research"></a> 

- The Role of Renewable Energies in the Sustainable Development of Post-Crisis Electrical Power Sectors Reconstructionhttps: The electric power sector in crisis-affected countries like Syria is among the most severely impacted infrastructures, essential for economic recovery and quality of life. This study examines the role of renewable energy (RES) in rebuilding Syriaâ€™s Electric Power Sector (SEPS) sustainably. Analyzing data from 2005 to 2017, it assesses SEPS before and during the crisis, highlighting challenges in adopting RES and sustainable development (SD) principles. Using EnergyPLAN software, various reconstruction scenarios were evaluated, emphasizing RESâ€™s potential to reduce emissions, enhance efficiency, create jobs, and stabilize the power supply. //www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/23/6326
